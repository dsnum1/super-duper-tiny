# super-duper-tiny
Contains source code for my TinyML project. Using Selenium I built a driver for an arduino to emulate keypresses. Using this, you can play Stick Cricket using a stick. 


Note that all the code is still a bit unorganized. If you need help with this project, contact me at my personal website: dsnum1.github.io/personal_website.
